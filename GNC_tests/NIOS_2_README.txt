The 'NIOS_2' folder is the root directory for:
- The implementation for the NIOS_II processor on DE10-Lite (Quartus Lite V16.1.0)
  Pins for the board have already been assigned, with output file generated
  * Works by opening the 'NIOS_2.QPF' file and uploading to the DE10-Lite Board
  (Currently has 175 kB on-chip memory, due to board limitations)

- The workspace for "NIOS II Software Build Tools for Eclipse", which can be opened by 
  going to "Quartus" -> "Tools" -> "NIOS II Software Build Tools for Eclipse"
  * Template not included, but can be easily generated by going to
    "File" -> "New" -> "NIOS II Application and BSP from Template"

    right click on project folder -> "Build Project".
